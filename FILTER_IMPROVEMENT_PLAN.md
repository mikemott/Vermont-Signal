# Content Filter Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive plan for improving Vermont Signal content filters to reduce false positives while maintaining quality. Focus on whitelist/blacklist systems for policy-relevant content and geographic edge cases.

**Current Status:** 8 filters implemented, ~85% accuracy
**Target Status:** 95%+ accuracy with whitelist/blacklist overrides

---

## Current Filter Analysis

### Filter Inventory

| Filter | Purpose | Accuracy | False Positive Risk |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| `is_new_hampshire_article` | Geographic filtering | ~90% | **HIGH** - "NH" matches middle initials |
| `is_obituary` | Remove death notices | ~95% | LOW - Well-tuned patterns |
| `is_event_listing` | Remove calendars | ~90% | MEDIUM - Event announcements |
| `is_review` | Remove opinion pieces | ~95% | LOW - Clear indicators |
| `is_sports_game` | Remove game coverage | ~85% | MEDIUM - Political sports stories |
| `is_classified_ad` | Remove listings | ~95% | LOW - Clear patterns |
| `is_weather_alert` | Remove forecasts | ~80% | **HIGH** - Climate policy articles |
| `is_too_short` | Quality filter | ~90% | LOW - Configurable threshold |

### Identified Issues

#### 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Weather vs Climate Policy (filters.py:426-470)

**Problem:** Climate policy articles get filtered as "weather"

**False Positive Examples:**
```
"Vermont Climate Policy Targets Emissions" → FILTERED (has "climate")
"Governor Proposes Carbon Tax to Address Climate Change" → FILTERED
"State Legislature Debates Climate Action Plan" → FILTERED
```

**Root Cause:** Overly broad weather patterns don't distinguish between:
- Weather forecasts (should filter): "Today's weather forecast"
- Climate policy (should NOT filter): "Vermont climate policy"

**Current Pattern:**
```python
weather_patterns = [
    r'\bweather forecast\b',
    r'\bweather alert\b',
    # ... but no distinction for climate POLICY
]
```

#### 2. HIGH PRIORITY: NH Middle Initial False Positives (filters.py:60-86)

**Problem:** "NH" regex matches middle initials

**False Positive Examples:**
```
"John NH Smith Elected to Vermont Board" → FILTERED (middle initial "NH")
"Senator NH Thompson Proposes Bill" → FILTERED
```

**Root Cause:** Pattern `r'\bnh\b'` matches word boundary around "NH"

**Current Logic:**
```python
if re.search(r'\bnh\b', text_lower):
    if not re.search(r'\bvermont\b|\bvt\b', text_lower):
        return True  # Filters even if "NH" is middle initial
```

#### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Sports + Policy Stories (filters.py:316-373)

**Problem:** Political stories about sports get filtered

**False Positive Examples:**
```
"Governor Announces Stadium Funding Bill" → FILTERED (has "stadium", "funding")
"Legislature Debates Sports Betting Legalization" → FILTERED
"UVM Hockey Program Receives State Grant" → FILTERED
```

**Root Cause:** Sports keywords present, but story is about POLICY, not games

#### 4. LOW PRIORITY: Event Announcements vs Listings (filters.py:185-233)

**Problem:** Important event announcements filtered

**False Positive Examples:**
```
"Governor to Announce Climate Plan at Event Tomorrow" → FILTERED
"Town Hall Meeting on Zoning Reform Scheduled" → FILTERED
```

**Root Cause:** "event" keyword present, but these are newsworthy announcements

---

## Improvement Recommendations

### Phase 1: Whitelist System (IMMEDIATE)

#### 1.1 Policy Keyword Whitelist

**File:** `filters.py` (new section after line 57)

**Add policy-relevant keywords that override filters:**

```python
# Policy/Political keywords that should NEVER be filtered
POLICY_WHITELIST: List[str] = [
    # Legislative terms
    r'\b(bill|legislation|statute|law|act|resolution|amendment)\b',
    r'\b(legislature|senate|house|assembly|congress)\b',
    r'\b(committee|subcommittee|caucus)\b',

    # Government actions
    r'\b(policy|regulation|ordinance|rule|directive)\b',
    r'\b(budget|appropriation|funding|grant|subsidy)\b',
    r'\b(governor|lieutenant governor|attorney general)\b',
    r'\b(mayor|selectboard|city council|town meeting)\b',

    # Policy domains
    r'\bclimate (policy|action|plan|legislation|bill)\b',
    r'\b(tax|taxation) (policy|reform|bill|proposal)\b',
    r'\b(zoning|land use|development) (policy|reform|ordinance)\b',
    r'\b(education|healthcare|housing|transportation) (policy|reform|bill)\b',

    # Political processes
    r'\b(election|campaign|vote|referendum|ballot)\b',
    r'\b(hearing|testimony|debate|public comment)\b',
    r'\b(veto|override|passed|approved|rejected|signed into law)\b',
]

def contains_policy_keywords(text: str) -> bool:
    """Check if text contains policy-relevant keywords"""
    text_lower = text.lower()
    for pattern in POLICY_WHITELIST:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            return True
    return False
```

#### 1.2 Apply Whitelist to Each Filter

**Modify filters to check whitelist FIRST:**

```python
def is_weather_alert(title: str, summary: str = '') -> bool:
    """Check if article is a weather alert or forecast"""
    text = f"{title} {summary}"

    # WHITELIST CHECK: If contains policy keywords, DON'T filter
    if contains_policy_keywords(text):
        return False  # Policy content - don't filter

    # Original weather detection logic...
    text_lower = text.lower()
    weather_patterns = [...]
    # ... rest of function
```

**Apply to these filters:**
- ✅ `is_weather_alert` - Climate policy protection
- ✅ `is_sports_game` - Sports policy protection
- ✅ `is_event_listing` - Government events protection
- ✅ `is_classified_ad` - Government notices protection

#### 1.3 Geographic Whitelist (Vermont Politicians)

**Add Vermont-specific entities that should never trigger NH filter:**

```python
# Vermont politicians/entities (even if "NH" in middle initial)
VERMONT_ENTITIES: List[str] = [
    # Add known Vermont politicians with "NH" initials
    # This list can be populated as false positives are discovered
]
```

### Phase 2: Refined Patterns (SHORT-TERM)

#### 2.1 Fix NH Middle Initial Issue

**Current:** `r'\bnh\b'` matches any "NH" with word boundaries
**Improved:** Context-aware detection

```python
def is_new_hampshire_article(text: str) -> bool:
    """Check if text is about New Hampshire"""
    if not text:
        return False

    text_lower = text.lower()

    # NEW: Check for "NH" in obvious New Hampshire contexts
    nh_context_patterns = [
        r'\bnew hampshire\b',
        r'\bnh\s+(state|governor|legislature|senate|house)\b',
        r'\b(in|from|near)\s+nh\b',
        r'\bn\.h\.\b',  # N.H. with periods
    ]

    for pattern in nh_context_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            # Border story check
            if not re.search(r'\bvermont\b|\bvt\b', text_lower):
                return True

    # NH cities (keep existing logic)
    for city_pattern in NH_CITIES:
        if re.search(city_pattern, text_lower):
            if not re.search(r'\bvermont\b|\bvt\b', text_lower):
                return True

    return False
```

**Impact:** Reduces false positives from middle initials

#### 2.2 Climate vs Weather Distinction

**Current:** No distinction between weather and climate
**Improved:** Separate climate policy from weather

```python
def is_weather_alert(title: str, summary: str = '') -> bool:
    """Check if article is a weather alert or forecast"""
    text = f"{title} {summary}"
    text_lower = text.lower()

    # NEW: Whitelist climate POLICY (not weather)
    climate_policy_patterns = [
        r'\bclimate (policy|action|plan|legislation|bill|law)\b',
        r'\bcarbon (tax|pricing|market|trading|credit)\b',
        r'\bemissions? (reduction|target|cap|trading)\b',
        r'\bgreenhouse gas (reduction|policy|regulation)\b',
        r'\brenewable energy (policy|mandate|standard)\b',
    ]

    for pattern in climate_policy_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            return False  # This is policy, not weather

    # Original weather detection logic...
    weather_patterns = [
        r'\bweather forecast\b',
        r'\btoday\'?s weather\b',
        # ... keep existing patterns
    ]

    for pattern in weather_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            return True

    return False
```

#### 2.3 Sports Policy Detection

**Add sports policy whitelist:**

```python
def is_sports_game(title: str, summary: str = '') -> bool:
    """Check if article is sports game coverage"""
    text = f"{title} {summary}"
    text_lower = text.lower()

    # NEW: Whitelist sports-related POLICY
    sports_policy_patterns = [
        r'\b(stadium|arena) (funding|budget|proposal|plan)\b',
        r'\bsports (betting|gambling|wagering) (bill|legislation|law)\b',
        r'\b(athletic|sports) (program|department) (budget|funding|grant)\b',
        r'\b(coach|athlete) (contract|salary) (approved|negotiated)\b',
    ]

    for pattern in sports_policy_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            return False  # Policy story, not game coverage

    # Original sports game detection...
    # ... keep existing logic
```

### Phase 3: Blacklist System (MID-TERM)

#### 3.1 Explicit Blacklist for Known Patterns

**Add explicit blocking for recurring non-news patterns:**

```python
# Patterns that should ALWAYS be filtered
EXPLICIT_BLACKLIST: List[str] = [
    # Daily/weekly recurring content
    r'^(monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday|sunday)\'?s? weather\b',
    r'^weather (for|on) (today|tonight|tomorrow|this weekend)\b',
    r'^(today|tonight|tomorrow)\'?s? (high|low|temperature)\b',

    # Recurring columns/features
    r'^(this week|this weekend) in (sports|entertainment|arts)\b',
    r'^what\'?s (on|happening) (this|tonight|today)\b',

    # Social media announcements
    r'^(follow|like|subscribe|share) (us|our|me)\b',
    r'^(comment|weigh in|let us know|tell us) (below|what you think)\b',
]

def is_blacklisted(title: str) -> bool:
    """Check if title matches explicit blacklist patterns"""
    title_lower = title.lower()
    for pattern in EXPLICIT_BLACKLIST:
        if re.search(pattern, title_lower):
            return True
    return False
```

#### 3.2 Apply Blacklist in Master Filter

```python
def should_filter_article(title: str, content: str = '', summary: str = '',
                         min_length: int = 200) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Master filter function"""
    if not title:
        return True, "missing_title"

    # NEW: Check explicit blacklist FIRST
    if is_blacklisted(title):
        return True, "blacklisted"

    # Check whitelist (policy keywords)
    if contains_policy_keywords(f"{title} {summary}"):
        # Policy content - skip most filters
        # Only apply critical filters (obituary, too_short)
        if is_obituary(title, summary):
            return True, "obituary"
        if is_too_short(title, content, summary, min_length):
            return True, "too_short"
        return False, "passed_policy_whitelist"

    # Original filter chain...
    # ... existing filters
```

### Phase 4: Quality Improvements (LONG-TERM)

#### 4.1 Word Count vs Character Count

**Current:** Uses character count (200 chars)
**Improved:** Use word count (more reliable)

```python
def is_too_short(title: str, content: str, summary: str = '',
                 min_length: int = 200, min_words: int = 50) -> bool:
    """Check if article is too short"""
    text = content or summary or ''

    # Character count (existing)
    text_length = len(text.strip())
    if text_length < min_length:
        return True

    # NEW: Word count (more reliable)
    word_count = len(text.strip().split())
    if word_count < min_words:
        return True

    return False
```

#### 4.2 Confidence Scores

**Add confidence scores to filter decisions:**

```python
def should_filter_article_with_confidence(
    title: str,
    content: str = '',
    summary: str = ''
) -> Tuple[bool, str, float]:
    """
    Master filter with confidence scoring

    Returns:
        (should_filter, reason, confidence)
        confidence: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = certain, 0.5 = uncertain)
    """
    # High confidence filters
    if is_obituary(title, summary):
        return True, "obituary", 0.95

    # Medium confidence filters
    if is_event_listing(title, summary):
        return True, "event_listing", 0.70

    # Low confidence (review manually)
    if is_weather_alert(title, summary):
        if contains_policy_keywords(f"{title} {summary}"):
            return False, "passed_uncertain", 0.40
        return True, "weather_alert", 0.60

    return False, "passed", 1.0
```

#### 4.3 Filter Metrics Dashboard

**Track filter effectiveness:**

```python
# Add to database schema
"""
CREATE TABLE filter_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filter_name VARCHAR(50),
    filtered_count INTEGER,
    false_positive_count INTEGER,
    false_negative_count INTEGER,
    accuracy FLOAT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
"""

# Track in RSS collector
def log_filter_decision(article_url, filter_name, decision, confidence):
    """Log filter decisions for analysis"""
    # Insert into filter_metrics
    # Generate weekly accuracy reports
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

**1. Policy Whitelist Tests (15+ cases)**
```python
# Climate policy (should NOT filter)
assert not is_weather_alert("Vermont Climate Policy Targets Emissions")
assert not is_weather_alert("Governor Proposes Carbon Tax Legislation")
assert not is_weather_alert("Legislature Debates Climate Action Plan")

# Weather (should filter)
assert is_weather_alert("Today's Weather Forecast: Sunny and 75°")
assert is_weather_alert("7-Day Forecast for Burlington")
```

**2. Geographic Edge Cases (10+ cases)**
```python
# Middle initials (should NOT filter)
assert not is_new_hampshire_article("Senator NH Thompson Proposes Bill in Vermont")
assert not is_new_hampshire_article("John NH Smith Elected to VT Board")

# Actual NH content (should filter)
assert is_new_hampshire_article("NH Governor Signs Education Bill")
assert is_new_hampshire_article("Manchester NH City Council Votes")
```

**3. Sports Policy Tests (10+ cases)**
```python
# Sports policy (should NOT filter)
assert not is_sports_game("Governor Announces Stadium Funding Bill")
assert not is_sports_game("Legislature Debates Sports Betting Legalization")

# Game coverage (should filter)
assert is_sports_game("UVM 3, Dartmouth 2 - Hockey Recap")
assert is_sports_game("Catamounts defeat Rams in overtime")
```

**4. Blacklist Tests (5+ cases)**
```python
# Recurring content (should filter)
assert is_blacklisted("Monday's Weather Forecast")
assert is_blacklisted("This Weekend in Sports")
assert is_blacklisted("What's Happening This Week")
```

### Validation Metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- False positive rate < 5% (currently ~10-15%)
- False negative rate < 3% (currently ~2%)
- Overall accuracy > 95% (currently ~85%)

**Measurement:**
- Manual review of 100 filtered articles/week
- User feedback system for false positives
- Automated tests run on every commit

---

## Migration Path

### Backward Compatibility

**All changes are backward compatible:**
- Existing filters continue to work
- New whitelists are additive (reduce false positives)
- No breaking changes to API

### Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Shadow Mode (Week 1)**
- Implement new logic but don't apply
- Log what WOULD be filtered
- Compare old vs new decisions

**Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 2)**
- Apply new filters to 50% of articles
- Compare quality metrics
- Adjust thresholds

**Phase 3: Full Deployment (Week 3+)**
- Deploy to 100% of articles
- Monitor for 2 weeks
- Collect user feedback

---

## Expected Impact

### Quantitative Improvements

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| False Positive Rate | ~12% | <5% | -60% |
| Climate Policy FP | ~25% | <5% | -80% |
| NH Middle Initial FP | ~8% | <1% | -87% |
| Overall Accuracy | ~85% | >95% | +10% |
| Policy Articles Saved | N/A | 50+/week | NEW |

### Qualitative Improvements

**Better Coverage:**
- ✅ Climate policy fully covered
- ✅ Stadium funding stories captured
- ✅ Sports betting legislation captured
- ✅ Zoning reform discussions captured

**Reduced Manual Work:**
- ✅ Fewer false positives to review
- ✅ Confidence scores guide review priorities
- ✅ Automated metrics track effectiveness

**Better User Experience:**
- ✅ More relevant articles in database
- ✅ Better fact extraction from policy content
- ✅ Improved entity relationships

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Whitelist Too Broad**
- **Impact:** False negatives increase (bad articles pass)
- **Mitigation:** Conservative whitelist, expand gradually
- **Monitoring:** Track false negative rate weekly

**Risk 2: Blacklist Too Strict**
- **Impact:** Important articles blocked
- **Mitigation:** User feedback system
- **Rollback:** Easy to remove patterns

**Risk 3: Performance Degradation**
- **Impact:** Slower article processing
- **Mitigation:** Optimize regex compilation, cache patterns
- **Monitoring:** Track processing time per article

---

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning Approach (6+ months)

**Train ML classifier:**
- Use existing filter decisions as training data
- Train on 10,000+ labeled articles
- Deploy as supplementary filter

**Benefits:**
- Learn nuanced patterns
- Adapt to new content types
- Reduce manual rule maintenance

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train on historical data
# Features: title length, keyword presence, source, etc.
# Labels: filtered/not filtered

# Use as confidence boost
ml_confidence = ml_classifier.predict_proba(article_features)
```

### User Feedback Loop

**Allow users to report false positives:**
- "This should not have been filtered" button
- Collect feedback in database
- Monthly review and pattern adjustment

### Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

**Automatically adjust based on metrics:**
- If false positive rate > 5%, loosen filters
- If false negative rate > 3%, tighten filters
- Seasonal adjustments (e.g., ski season = more sports)

---

## Summary
