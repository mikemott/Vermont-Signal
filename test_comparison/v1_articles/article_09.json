Kevin \u201cCoach\u201d Christie, D-Windsor 6, one of few Black representatives in the Legislature, said people of color in Vermont know that bias in policing persists in the state. Nasreddin-Longo\u2019s presence on the committee and his work to change that \u201chelped turn that dial down.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent removal, however, sends a very different message, Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re all better now. We\u2019re fixed. We don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat does this say about the \u2018Brave Little State\u2019 and the exceptionalism we so often claim?\u201d Christie wrote in a social media post last week. \u201cAre we truly committed to fairness and equity, or are we beginning to placate anti-DEI sentiment in response to a shifting political landscape?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State officials and Nasreddin-Longo did not immediately respond to comment.</p>\n<p>Read the story on VTDigger here:  <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/09/29/longtime-advocate-for-fairness-and-policing-reform-is-no-longer-with-state/\">Longtime advocate for fairness and policing reform is no longer with state</a>.</p>",
