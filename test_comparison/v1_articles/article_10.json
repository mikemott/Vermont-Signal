The letter asks why the company that manages the listing, London-based FTSE Russell, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-media-stock-rises-as-company-joins-pair-of-russell-indexes-8671956\">decided last year to make</a> Trump Media &amp; Technology Group a part of its index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to Pieciak, the letter was signed by state fiscal leaders from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maryland, as well the comptroller of New York City.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media &amp; Technology\u2019s most prominent brand is Truth Social, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/02/22/1082243094/trumps-social-media-app-launches-year-after-twitter-ban\">the social media network Trump launched in 2022</a> after he was banned from what was then Twitter. The president\u2019s company, which trades under the symbol DJT, also operates <a href=\"https://www.truthsocial.tv/\">Truth+, a streaming service</a>, and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/truth-social-crypto-etf-launch-donald-trump-meme-coin-schwab-2025-1\">launched a financial technology platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pieciak and the other state treasurers and comptrollers wrote that the inclusion of Trump\u2019s company in the Russell 3000 Index \u201cundermines\u201d the index\u2019s credibility. That\u2019s because the company has lost more than half of its value since it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-truth-social-nasdaq-stock-106d7c423174ca1d7cc3cc9a3f3897a0\">debuted on the stock market in March 2024</a>, they wrote, while at the same time, generating \u201cnegligible revenues.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Trump-related ventures, they added, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/business/truth-social-trump-media-crypto.html\">have been similarly volatile for investors</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-trump-family-cashes-in-on-the-infinite-money-glitch-edcaca1d\">a meme cryptocurrency coin and non-fungible token trading cards</a>, which \u201csurged briefly before collapsing, leaving many investors with heavy losses.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe continued presence of TMTG in the index raises troubling questions on both financial and governance grounds, as well as on the integrity of the benchmark itself,\u201d Pieciak and the other state leaders wrote in the letter, which was sent Sept. 29.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pieciak and Vermont\u2019s other Democratic statewide officials have repeatedly taken aim at Trump and actions taken by his administration since the president took office for a second term. Attorney General Charity Clark has joined other states to <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/vermont-trump-lawsuits/\">sue the Trump administration more than two dozen times</a> since January, while Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/13/vermont-secretary-of-state-says-she-wont-share-voter-data-with-trump-administration/\">has pushed back on efforts</a> by Trump\u2019s Department of Justice to obtain sensitive voter data.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-1c1b4f74 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0;\">READ MORE</h5>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/vermont-trump-lawsuits/\"><img alt=\"A woman speaking into multiple microphones at a press conference, gesturing with her hand.

Phil Scott, who has urged state leaders to be less confrontational in what he\u2019s said is an effort to protect Vermont\u2019s existing federal funding and benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, Scott rejected two requests over the summer from the White House to use Vermont\u2019s national guard to aid <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/31/didnt-make-a-whole-lot-of-sense-to-me-vermont-governor-rejects-bid-for-guard-members-to-help-ice/\">federal immigration enforcement</a> and <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/15/phil-scott-rejects-trump-administration-request-to-use-vermont-national-guard-in-presidents-dc-crackdown/\">crack down on crime in Washington, D.C.</a> But he also drew sharp criticism for complying with <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/06/phil-scott-faces-criticism-over-decision-to-share-snap-recipients-personal-data-with-feds/\">a request to share data on nutritional benefit recipients</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pieciak said in an interview Thursday that more than $10.6 trillion in assets flow through the Rusell 3000, which includes retirement accounts, college saving plans and some state pension funds. Vermont\u2019s public pension plans are not invested using the Russell index, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he noted that it\u2019s likely many Vermonters are invested in funds that automatically buy whatever shares are part of the Russell index. That means many people likely own a piece, albeit small, of Trump\u2019s media company, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social-russell\">even if they don\u2019t realize it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The treasurer said Trump\u2019s media company is unique among the companies in the index because its value is largely based around the political capital of a single \u2014 albeit extremely powerful \u2014 person, rather than its own underlying financial success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter asks FTSE Russell for \u201ca clear explanation of the criteria and methodology used to include\u201d Trump\u2019s company in the Russell 3000, as well as \u201can assessment of how FTSE Russell has accounted for TMTG\u2019s financial instability\u201d and what safeguards the index will use to ensure future additions \u201creflect sound market fundamentals.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn some ways, it is the first of its kind,\u201d Pieciak said.</p>\n<p>Read the story on VTDigger here:  <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/10/05/vermonts-state-treasurer-takes-aim-at-trumps-media-company/\">Vermont\u2019s state treasurer takes aim at Trump\u2019s media company</a>.</p>",

    "enhanced_summary": "Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak led a coalition of six state fiscal leaders in challenging the inclusion of Trump Media & Technology Group in the Russell 3000 Index, a major stock market benchmark tracking 3,000 of America's largest companies. In a September 29 letter to London-based FTSE Russell, Pieciak and counterparts from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York City questioned why Trump's company\u2014which operates Truth Social and has lost more than half its value since its March 2024 debut while generating \"negligible revenues\"\u2014remains in the index. The treasurers argued that the company's inclusion \"undermines\" the index's credibility and raises \"troubling questions on both financial and governance grounds.\"\n\nThis action represents the latest in a pattern of Vermont Democratic officials challenging Trump administration policies and related business ventures since the president's second term began. Attorney General Charity Clark has similarly joined multi-state lawsuits against various Trump administration actions, indicating coordinated state-level resistance. The letter's high controversy rating (8/10) and negative sentiment (-0.6) reflect the politically charged nature of state treasurers\u2014who oversee billions in pension and investment funds\u2014questioning investment decisions related to the sitting president's business interests. The officials also cited Trump's volatile crypto ventures, including a meme coin and NFT trading cards that \"surged briefly before collapsing, leaving many investors with heavy losses.\"\n\nThe challenge carries significant implications for public pension funds and institutional investors who use the Russell 3000 as a benchmark for portfolio allocation, potentially affecting billions in managed assets. The state treasurers' involvement signals growing concern among fiduciaries about potential conflicts of interest when presidential business ventures influence major market indexes. While the letter requests an explanation from FTSE Russell, it remains unclear whether the index manager will respond publicly or reconsider Trump Media's inclusion, though the coordinated action from multiple state fiscal officers adds political pressure to what they frame as a financial governance issue.",
