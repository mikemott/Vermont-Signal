ALBANS CITY \u2014- On Tuesday, Dairy Farmers of America workers showed up to strike for the sixth day on Federal Street and stood with picket signs, their backs facing the towering silos and white warehouses where they usually work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workers, part of the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union, went on strike Thursday in a push for higher pay and what they consider to be a more fair overtime work policy. Employees are asking for an 8% increase in hourly wages. And after Lt. Governor John Rodgers visited the picket line Sunday, he said in an interview that he could be getting personally involved in negotiations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union members have been bargaining with the Kansas based dairy company since June, said Curtis Clough, the union\u2019s organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, earlier this month, the company hired a number of temporary employees in non-union roles, which the teamsters considered to be an act of bad faith, said Dustin Reed, a teamster on strike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a struggle against corporate America,\u201d Reed said. And he feels like the little guy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dairy Farmers of America <a href=\"https://www.dairyfoods.com/articles/96255-dairy-farmers-of-america-reports-2022-net-income-of-108m\">reported making</a> over $108 million in net income in 2022, with $24.5 billion in net sales that year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dairy company did not respond to requests for an interview and instead emailed a statement that stated they\u2019ve been actively negotiating with the union. \u201cWe are disappointed that the Teamsters walked away from that process and have initiated a strike at the St. Albans plant,\u201d the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A group of people stand on a sidewalk holding signs that read &quot;Teamsters Local 597 On Strike&quot; and demand fair contracts.\" class=\"wp-image-632583\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dfa-strike-1-20250930-1200x798.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Members of the Teamsters local 597 union picket outside the Dairy Farmers of America plant in St. Albans on Tuesday, September 30, 2025.

In addition to Ben and Jerry\u2019s, the facility sells to Kate\u2019s Butter and others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the strike began, Clough said he estimates the facility is operating at about 10% capacity, with the temporary non-union employees filling some gaps in staffing while the strike continues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clough said that transport trucks have had to dump out thousands of gallons of milk because the facility doesn\u2019t have the capacity to process the perishable product without the union employees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018They\u2019re not asking for a lot\u2019</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, the strike drew the attention of Lt. Governor John Rodgers, who visited the picket line Sunday and posted <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teamsters/posts/workers-at-the-dairy-farmers-of-america-dfa-st-albans-facility-in-vermont-held-a/1204796538355812/\">a video on Facebook</a> voicing support for their cause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to maintain healthy agriculture, we\u2019ve got to pay the workers good, we\u2019ve got to pay the farmers good. Everybody needs to make a living,\u201d Rodgers said in the video. He asked \u201ceveryone\u201d to support the teamsters&#8217; strike and to push the dairy company to show up to the bargaining table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teamsters also visited the Ben and Jerry\u2019s Factory in Waterbury on Sunday. Union members handed out flyers to customers and visitors to make them aware of the ice cream company\u2019s ties to their employer, Clough said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed, who lives in Enosburg and grew up on a dairy farm, has worked at the facility for 22 years. He said that, recently, managers have been forcing senior employees to work significant overtime, which violates the company\u2019s contract with the union. Clough said some company employees rejected those claims during meetings with the union.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worker on strike, Alan Boutin, doesn&#8217;t trust management. He believes he was wrongfully terminated last fall, but wasn\u2019t re-hired until last week after the union negotiated with management for months. Throughout the process, managers made many promises they didn\u2019t keep, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bullshit going on here. It shouldn\u2019t be that way,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Two people hold picket signs reading &quot;TEAMSTERS LOCAL 597 ON STRIKE&quot; and &quot;STOP EXCESSIVE OVERTIME AND HARASSMENT&quot; near a tanker truck parked by the roadside.\" class=\"wp-image-632580\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dfa-strike-4-20250930-1200x798.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A Dairy Farmers of America milk truck drives past members of the Teamsters local 597 union picketing outside the plant in St. Albans on Tuesday, September 30, 2025.

And Rodgers, who grew up on a dairy farm in the Kingdom, said he knows that to be true as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations with management on Monday moved things in the right direction, but still aren\u2019t meeting workers\u2019 needs, Clough said. They hope to include Rodgers in the process to put more pressure on the company, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview, Rodgers said he offered to support the teamsters however they saw fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not asking for a lot,\u201d Rodgers said. He said that a company as large and profitable as DFA should be able to pay their workers more. Rodgers is happy to sit down at the table with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI want to see them back to work,\u201d Rodgers said.</p>\n<p>Read the story on VTDigger here:  <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/09/30/workers-charge-bs-as-strike-at-st-albans-dairy-plant-heads-into-second-week/\">Workers charge \u2018BS\u2019 as strike at St. Albans dairy plant heads into second week</a>.</p>",
