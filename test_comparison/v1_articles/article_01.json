Gobin, acting as his own attorney, then appealed to Superior Court later that month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gobin, who lives on Maple Avenue and owns residential rental property abutting Granite State Packing on Sullivan Street, had argued in his appeal that the board failed to satisfy the five criteria required in the city&#8217;s ordinance for a variance and further claimed one board member had a conflict of interest because she raises birds for slaughter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said the board did not consider evidence that slaughterhouses bring an increase in violent crimes and diminish surrounding property values. Finally a statement allegedly made by the former city manager that the slaughterhouse was \u201calready a done deal,\u201d shows the board had predetermined the variance would be granted, Gobin said in his appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe city objects, asserting that the plaintiff failed to preserve certain arguments and that the record is sufficient to demonstrate that the ZBA acted reasonably in granting the variance,\u201d court documents state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klass reviewed each of Gobin\u2019s arguments beginning with the criteria to issue&nbsp;a variance listed in the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, such as not being contrary to public benefit, will do substantial justice and won\u2019t diminish property values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Gobin\u2019s request to the zoning board for a rehearing, he did not address the five criteria, including unnecessary hardship to the owner if denied and public interest in a \u201cmeaningful way,\u201d and cannot do so on appeal, Klass said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe court will not consider objections to the Facility that are made for the first time on appeal,\u201d Klass wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Gobin alluded to the criteria in his motion for a rehearing he did not include any supporting evidence even though such evidence was readily available, Klass said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the issues of whether the presence of a slaughterhouse increases&nbsp;violent crime, Klass noted that competing evidence was presented by residents opposed to the slaughterhouse and Granite State Packing. The court\u2019s role, he said, is limited and it is the zoning board that is tasked with resolving conflicts in evidence and determining the credibility of the proof presented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhether the ZBA could have found differently is immaterial, and the Court will not step into the shoes of the ZBA and act as a super zoning board,\u201d Klass wrote. \u201cWith those principles in mind, the court must conclude that the plaintiff has failed to establish that the ZBA acted unreasonably.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, with a claim of diminishing property values, Klass said with \u201ccompeting evidence presented\u201d the court will defer to the ZBA\u2019s finding on this issue, which said property values are not diminished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the question of a conflict of interest of one board member, Aran Lafontaine, who raises birds for slaughter, Klass cited state law disqualifying anyone with a \u201cpecuniary (financial) interest\u201d in the outcome that differs from the interest of other citizens, and called Gobin\u2019s claim on a conflict \u201cspeculative.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ruling says it is not enough that the board member could have personal relationships with farmers and producers who will benefit financially from a slaughterhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The mere fact Ms. Lafontaine raises birds does not mean she cannot be impartial in deciding whether to allow a pork slaughterhouse where a current meat processing plant operates,\u201d Klass wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He agreed with the city and concluded that Gobin failed to demonstrate that an \u201cimpermissible conflict of interest exists in this case.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, on the question of a statement about the variance being a \u201cdone deal\u201d attributed to former City Manager Yoshi Manale, which he denied, Klass said even if the statement were true, the court cannot conclude the board acted in error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said there is no evidence of a predetermined outcome of the variance request, that Manale was not a member of the board and Gobin did not establish that the statement had any influence on the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe allegation, by itself, is insufficient to serve as the basis to reverse the ZBA\u2019s decision in this case,\u201d Klass wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attempts to reach Gobin for comment were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://vnews.com/2025/10/03/slaughterhouse-variance-appeal-dismissed/\">Court rules in favor of proposed Claremont slaughterhouse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vnews.com\">Valley News</a>.</p>",

    "enhanced_summary": "A Hillsborough Superior Court judge has dismissed an appeal challenging Granite State Packing's plans to add a slaughterhouse to its Claremont facility, clearing the way for the project to seek site plan approval. Judge Michael Klass issued a 10-page ruling rejecting property owner Brian Gobin's challenge to a variance the Zoning Board of Adjustment granted in January. The proposed indoor facility would process 250 pigs weekly, expanding operations at the pork processing plant that opened in 2023 in the former North Country Smokehouse location. Gobin, who owns residential rental property adjacent to the Sullivan Street site, had argued the zoning board failed to meet required criteria and raised concerns about increased violent crime and diminished property values associated with slaughterhouses.\n\nThis ruling represents one of four agriculture-related articles this week, though it carries a notably positive sentiment (0.4) compared to the week's average of -0.30 across similar topics. The controversy level of 7/10 reflects the significant community opposition the project has faced, with Gobin acting as his own attorney in challenging both the zoning board's decision and alleging conflicts of interest among board members. Judge Klass determined that Gobin failed to preserve certain arguments during the initial zoning board process and could not introduce them on appeal, noting that while competing evidence on crime rates was presented, the court's role was limited to reviewing whether the zoning board acted reasonably rather than re-evaluating evidence credibility.\n\nThe decision marks a significant victory for Granite State Packing and local agricultural infrastructure, though it remains controversial for neighboring property owners concerned about industrial meat processing in proximity to residential areas. The company must now submit a site plan application to the Planning Board, which has not yet been filed, representing the next regulatory hurdle before construction can begin. The case highlights ongoing tensions in New Hampshire communities between economic development, agricultural expansion, and residential quality-of-life concerns, particularly regarding industrial-scale food processing facilities in mixed-use zones.",
