Phil Scott\u2019s leadership team announced  Friday afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision addresses how out-of-state workers will be treated under Scott\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/politics/phil-scotts-return-to-office-order-triggers-determined-pushback/\">back-to-office requirement</a>, which takes effect December 1. The new hybrid work policy requires all employees \u2014 regardless of where they live \u2014 to work from the office at least three days a week. Two day of remote work will be permitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How that will affect the dozens of workers who live in California, Texas or South Carolina and elsewhere has been a burning question since the policy shift was announced in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe fully acknowledge the very real and significant impact this principle \u2026 has on employees who currently live in another state,\u201d Sarah Clark, secretary of administration, said in an email to employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new policy gives out-of-state workers until June 30, 2026 to begin reporting to the office three days a week if they agree in writing that they will relocate. They must do so by November 21.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If they commit to doing so, the person\u2019s current remote work arrangement will be honored, the new policy reads. If the person either can\u2019t or won\u2019t relocate, the state will look for someone else to do their job, the policy reads. In specific cases where someone else can\u2019t be found to do that same work, exceptions can be made but only with the approval of the governor\u2019s cabinet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt will require a rigorous approval process and will need to be reviewed annually,\u201d the policy reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptions may be granted for spouses of military members who relocate, or in certain cases involving court orders or if someone\u2019s personal safety is at risk, such as if they have a stalker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, which represents about 6,000 people in the state\u2019s workforce, said the new policy shows the \u201cshort-sightedness of this whole endeavor.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think all this is going to cause is the loss of a lot of talent,\u201d Howard said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The policy appears designed to \u201cpush people out,\u201d with little regard for how the Vermonters being served by those workers will be affected, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think this is the DOGEing of Vermont,\u201d Howard said, referring to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency formerly run by billionaire businessman Elon Musk. \u201cThis is Phil Scott aligning with Elon Musk and Donald Trump in a state that does not align with Elon Musk and Donald Trump.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott has argued the return-to-office mandate is more about team building and ensuring that workers are more available to serve Vermonters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe reality is, we need to get together more in person across departments and agencies,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see that something has been lost when we only see each other on the screen.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard said all the policy will do is make it harder to retain talented workers and put pressure on the real estate market for those who are forced to return to keep their jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>State officials have said they are also working on a separate commuting policy that might create exemptions for people with long commutes, but that policy has yet to be approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/distant-state-workers-get-nine-months-to-relocate/\">Distant State Workers Get Nine Months to Relocate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com\">Seven Days</a>.</p>",
