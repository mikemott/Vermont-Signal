His work as an environmental consultant had required lots of out-of-state travel, and now he wanted more time at home with his wife and daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He accepted a post with the Department of Environmental Conservation managing grants to upgrade drinking water systems that would more effectively remove pollutants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The money wasn\u2019t great, but the benefits were decent. And working full time from his home in Buels Gore, a remote unincorporated area in the mountains south of Camel\u2019s Hump, saved him money on gas and other car expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So O\u2019Brien felt blindsided when Gov. Phil Scott announced in August that he will require all state workers to return to the office at least three days a week beginning December 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI consider this a total betrayal of the terms under which I accepted my position,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\u2019s not alone. Many state workers are livid about Scott\u2019s order, denouncing it as a politically motived decision that ignores what they say are the efficiencies and improved job satisfaction that come with remote work. They predict that the mandate will lead to mass departures from state service, particularly of younger workers who have embraced remote work as a normal part of modern employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe world of five or six years ago is not the world that we live in today,\u201d said Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees\u2019 Association, which represents about 6,000 people in the state\u2019s workforce. More than 3,500 union members have signed a petition opposing the governor\u2019s order, and Howard has blasted Scott for pursuing a top-down policy Howard says makes no sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;It\u2019s not hard to see that something has been lost when we only see each other on the screen.&#8221;</p><cite>Gov. Phil Scott</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The state\u2019s most recent employee satisfaction survey, released in September, shows that workers appreciate the flexibility of being able to work from home. Roughly nine out of 10 employees agreed that working remotely improves their job performance and promotes work-life balance and also indicated they can collaborate with colleagues well from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy do an employee-engagement survey if you\u2019re just going to ignore what your employees are telling you?\u201d Howard asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott has been clear about the reasons he thinks most state workers ought to spend at least a few days a week in a state office building. That will bring more \u201cconsistency and predictability\u201d to the organization, he said in a video message to employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe reality is, we need to get together more in person across departments and agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see that something has been lost when we only see each other on the screen.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott\u2019s leadership team has been working overtime to quell the revolt and convince workers and the public that the new requirement is in everyone\u2019s best interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis approach will provide a consistent balance across agencies and departments and increase interactions between teams, and result in more effective collaboration, communication, and connection,\u201d spokesperson Amanda Wheeler wrote in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Administration Secretary Sarah Clark, who is largely responsible for implementing the change, told employees the new hybrid schedule sought to strike a balance between workers\u2019 preferences and the expectations of the people they serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVermonters value access to their government, a visible presence in the communities we serve, and insight into how we work collectively in service to them,\u201d Clark wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his video message, Scott stressed that he didn\u2019t make the decision lightly and values the flexibility remote work offers employees. That\u2019s why he\u2019s allowing a hybrid schedule instead of ordering everyone back to the office full time, which was the expectation before the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even three days in the office is too much, many workers say. They have gotten so accustomed to the rhythms and benefits of remote work that they recoil at the prospect of returning to the office even part time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Jacobs, an energy analyst in the Department of Public Service, said Scott\u2019s order has prompted him to consider looking for other work. He lives in Winooski and views remote work as key to achieving a work-life balance. Scott\u2019s back-to-office mandate is a \u201cone-size-fits-most policy\u201d that doesn\u2019t suit his growing family, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have a 3-year-old son with another on the way in February, so a 40-mile commute isn\u2019t going to work for us,\u201d Jacobs said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time wasted commuting and its environmental impacts are the most common complaints. For others, it\u2019s not the commute so much as the office environment awaiting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A data manager for the Agency of Human Services who only goes into the office once a week says spending two more days a week there isn\u2019t going to make her more productive or collaborative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manager, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation, now reports to the Waterbury State Office Complex. But the work environment there is far from ideal. She works in one of the large, open circular spaces she calls \u201cthe turret.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The room in the historic former hospital has high ceilings and horrible acoustics and is in disarray, she said. \u201cPretty much our turret is just full of broken chairs and broken office equipment and piles of trash,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of her work is done through videoconference meetings on the Teams platform with the people she manages and other members of state government, she said. Driving to Waterbury won\u2019t accomplish much in the way of team building, she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to be sitting there with my headphones on in Teams meetings in that loud turret all day,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other workers question whether the state has enough office space, given the sale or pending sale of properties such as the Zampieri State Office Building in Burlington, which once hosted more than 400 workers but is now empty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new policy creates a particular conundrum for full-time employees who live outside Vermont. Their numbers have risen 42 percent, from 528 in 2020 to 753 in 2024, according to data from the state Human Resources Department.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not clear how many of those workers were hired with the understanding they could work remotely and how many were longer-term employees for whom expectations changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A large number of out-of-state workers live in adjacent states: 289 in New Hampshire, 230 in New York and 52 in Massachusetts, according to state data. Many live just over the border from Vermont.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of workers, however, live in more distant states, including California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Texas, Florida and South Carolina. They obviously will not be able to comply with Scott\u2019s order without relocating, said Doug Farnham, the state\u2019s chief recovery officer. Farnham is leading a task force of agency managers trying to iron out details of how the return-to-office mandate will affect individual workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One question is whether to create exemptions for employees facing long commutes, he said, either in terms of distance or commuting time. The state will likely exempt workers from the in-office requirement during bad weather or when workers are not feeling well but are healthy enough to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for workers in distant states, Farnham sees a bigger challenge. Vermont is unlikely to give these employees a blanket exemption, although they\u2019re likely to be given more time to comply with the return-to-office order. For future hires, a system could be implemented to ensure state jobs are offered to Vermont-based workers first, Farnham said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe do strongly feel that you should have a connection to Vermont if you are going to serve Vermonters,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some lawmakers are getting an earful from constituents. Rep. Tom Stevens (D-Waterbury) said the rollout of the policy was botched and called it the latest example of the administration\u2019s \u201chabit of shooting first and aiming later.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith a large number of employees having been hired as remote workers, one might think to ask them what the financial and familial challenges would be before announcing such a change,\u201d he told <em class=\"em\">Seven Days</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard said he\u2019s frustrated the new policy was announced without consulting the union and that potential exemptions are being decided by a group of managers without union input. The secrecy around the process has deepened workers\u2019 distrust of the administration and spawned speculation about the real motives behind the effort, Howard said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some feel that Scott may just be following the lead of Donald Trump, who ordered most federal workers back to the office in one of his first acts as president, or Elon Musk, who has strict office work policies at his private companies Tesla and X. Others feel Scott may be trying to prompt state employees to quit ahead of tighter state budgets on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another theory holds that Scott is listening to business owners in Montpelier and other cities with state offices who want workers back to boost local businesses. Some also speculate that Scott is just trying to fill empty state office buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farnham, the recovery officer, said floods that damaged state offices in 2023 and 2024 delayed return-to-office efforts. But in planning for the return-to-office initiative, managers discovered that remote-work practices varied widely among departments and even among people with similar job responsibilities, he said. Further, the state has no way of knowing how many people work remotely or how often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farnham declined to say whether some employees have abused their remote work privileges, but agreed the workforce\u2019s productivity overall was \u201cexcellent.\u201d He did note, however, that some remote workers haven\u2019t been to their office for more than a year, which makes team-building tough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some supervisors have embraced remote work, others believe in-office work is more valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to set something in the middle,\u201d Farnham said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farnham said he is a bit of an introvert and values the quiet time he spends working from home. But there have been plenty of occasions when he needed in-office mentoring from colleagues, such as when he worked in the tax department and someone had to look over his shoulder to explain complex corporate tax forms. The compromise policy is meant to allow workers to benefit from both work environments, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For O\u2019Brien, the DEC environmental analyst, that middle ground doesn\u2019t work. As it is, he travels to Montpelier once a month for meetings with colleagues. To go in three days a week, he\u2019d have to buy a second car, he said. O\u2019Brien said he and others might support the new plan if they felt more in-office time would improve their performance, but they do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O\u2019Brien said he knows some might see employees\u2019 position as self-serving, but he just wants to be financially able to do a job he loves that is important for the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about being able to show up to work in your pajama pants,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"printhead\">The original print version of this article was headlined &#8220;Remote Control | State employees push back against Gov.
