6. Click **Deploy**

**Step 3: Generate Domain**
1. Stay in API service settings
2. Go to **Networking** tab
3. Click **Generate Domain**
4. Copy the URL (e.g., `vermont-signal-production.up.railway.app`)

**Step 4: Test**
```bash

### Method 2: Via CLI (Interactive Terminal)

Open your terminal and run these commands **one at a time**:

```bash
# 1. Add empty service (will prompt for name: "api")
railway add

# 2. Link to the service you just created
railway service
# Select "api" from the list

# 3. Set environment variables
railway variables --set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
railway variables --set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
railway variables --set OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"

# 4. Deploy
railway up

# 5. Check status
railway status

# 6. Generate domain
railway domain
```

## üìã Environment Variables Needed

From your `.env` file, copy these values:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Claude API key
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your GPT API key

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Worker Service (Optional - Can Do Later)

Once API is working, add worker service:

1. In Railway dashboard ‚Üí `+ New` ‚Üí `Empty Service`
2. Name it: **worker**
3. Connect same GitHub repo
4. Set **Config Path**: `railway.worker.json`
5. Copy same environment variables from API service
6. Deploy

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Get your API URL first
railway status

# Test health
curl https://YOUR-URL/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}

# Test stats
curl https://YOUR-URL/api/stats
# Expected: {"articles":{"processed":0,...}}

# Check logs
railway logs
```

## üéØ Current Status

‚úÖ Project created: `vermont-signal`
‚úÖ PostgreSQL database added
‚è≥ API service needs to be added (via dashboard or CLI above)
‚è≥ Environment variables need to be set
‚è≥ Domain needs to be generated

**Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes via dashboard**

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use dashboard method - it's faster and shows you what's happening
- Worker service can wait - get API working first
- DATABASE_URL is automatically provided by Railway
- railway.toml will automatically configure the API service
